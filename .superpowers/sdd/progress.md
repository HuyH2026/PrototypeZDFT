# Front-End Foundation — Progress Ledger

Branch: feat/frontend-foundation
Plan: docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-20-frontend-foundation.md

Task 1: complete (commits ed61f4c..3482424, review clean — 2 reviewer "Critical" findings verified false: baseUrl removed in TS7 so cannot be re-added; extra pnpm/gitignore files are necessary env plumbing, ws file deleted in Task 11)
Task 2: complete (commits 34628aa..7288edd, review clean — approved, verbatim port verified)
Task 3: complete (commits d64925c..40f5c06, review clean — approved, prefix boundary logic verified)
Task 4: complete (commits ed93df7..05bfd21, review clean — approved, routing URL-driven from NAV_ITEMS)
Task 5: complete (commits 0e5ca23..3535d19, approved + 2 fixes applied: flyover flex-offset alignment, dead ternary removed). MINOR for final review: sidebar uses raw hex for hover/separator/flyover-border colors (#39434B, rgba(92,105,112,0.08), #e8eaec, #eae9e8, #0c0c0d) — no matching token exists yet; consider tokenizing hover states in a later polish pass.
Task 6: complete (commits 199bbbe..1ee13a5, approved + fixes: submenu links navigate, SF_Pro fonts removed from ExpandedSidebar+OrgSwitcher, fluid sidebar root, strengthened org-switch test). All fixes verified: 7/7 covering tests pass.
Task 7: complete (commits 45de557..95268d3, controller-verified — trivial fluid Home surface + contract test, matches brief, full suite 18/18)
Task 8: complete (commits 673d519..7cdf29d, review clean — approved, nested routes correct, honest empty views, BUILT-set intact)
Task 9: complete (commits 5186558..8e10176, approved + test tightened: create-org assertion scoped to dashboard via within(screen-organization)). Fluid rebuild verified, single provider intact, 4/4 org tests + 24/24 full suite pass.
Task 10: complete (commit db4b070..733a1ca, controller-verified — new App.tsx has NO double OrgProvider, main.tsx imports app-styles, old app/App.tsx deleted + unreferenced, npx vite build succeeds, tsc errors only in src/imports/ old files, 24/24 tests pass)
Task 11: complete (commits 0550d7e..2b15f3b, DONE_WITH_CONCERNS resolved by controller). Deleted src/imports, old components, guidelines, scratch files, default_shadcn_theme; promoted app-styles->styles; relocated ui+figma to src/components; cleaned vite.config/index.html; rewrote README+CLAUDE.md (controller rewrote CLAUDE.md — subagent version was fabricated). FINAL GATE: tsc clean, lint 0 errors (1 benign context warning), 24/24 tests, vite build succeeds. NOTE: TypeScript pinned 7.0.2->5.9.2 (user decision) because typescript-eslint cannot parse TS7; ui kit excluded from eslint.
